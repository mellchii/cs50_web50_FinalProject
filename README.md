This project is an Inventory Management
System for a Farm Warehouse which has a section for Staff to manage the farm inventory and another section to allow users place online orders for farm produce.

The project was built using the Django framework on the back-end and JavaScript on the frontend.
The application is mobile-responsive.

## Description
- Registered staff (Staff) of the farm can access the Stock Manager Dashboard to view a summary of all products, number of registered customers,
current stock value, number of completed and incomplete Orders and total placed Order value.

after a successful order has been placed.

ratings for a farm produce and rendering the appropriate star level to users. 
- Extension of the search functionality beyond product name to product description. Queries return appropriate results for part of a name or part of a description.
